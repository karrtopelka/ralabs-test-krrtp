# Karrtopelka weather app ðŸŒ©

Karrtopelka weather is the test task for me from Ralabs

## Installation

Open the console and locate into your folder (for example):

```
D:\ralabs-clone>
```

Then type:

```
git init
```

You should see a message like:

> Initialized empty Git repository in D:/ralabs-clone/.git/

Type (copy-paste):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/karrtopelka/ralabs-test-krrtp.git
```

### ðŸŽ‰ You successfully cloned git repo!ðŸŽŠ

## Usage

Navigate to cloned folder:

```
cd ralabs-test-krrtp
```

And now you need to install all missing packages from package.json. So you simply need to type:

```
npm install
```

It takes a while, but when downloading is completed, you can type:

```
yarn start
```

### And you're welcome! ðŸ˜Š

If you're using VSCode, go to your console, hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd>, and then write:

```
code .
```

Hope it helps.
